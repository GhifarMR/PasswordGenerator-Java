## 🔒 What is this?

In an era of increasing cyber threats, using "password123" is no longer safe. This tool allows you to generate high-entropy, random strings that are nearly impossible to guess. You can customize exactly what goes into your password to meet the requirements of any website or service.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Custom Length Control**: Choose exactly how many characters you want (e.g., 12, 16, or 24).
* **Character Selection**: Mix and match what your password contains:
    * **Uppercase & Lowercase**: Standard alphabet characters.
    * **Numbers**: Numeric digits from 0-9.
    * **Symbols**: Special characters (like `!@#$%^&*`) for maximum security.
* **One-Click Copy**: Once generated, you can instantly copy the password to your clipboard to paste it wherever you need it.
* **Real-time Preview**: See your generated password immediately in the display box.
